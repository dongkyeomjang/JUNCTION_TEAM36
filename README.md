Pohang City is dedicated to creating a **"livable city"** by enhancing the quality of life for its citizens through the effective resolution of urban challenges. To achieve this, the city aims to develop a smart city driven by comprehensive **data-driven digitalization**.

A key focus is on innovating public administration through the collection and analysis of data, including the use of **Lidar technology** to identify and address urban issues based on citizen complaints.

Despite the severity of current traffic problems in Pohang, the city has been unable to address them effectively due to a lack of complaints and insufficient data. By implementing a data-driven **"Intelligent Transportation System,"** Pohang can achieve true digital administrative innovation and more accurately resolve these issues.

This system would involve:

- **Attaching Lidar sensors to traffic lights** to gather critical data.
- Collecting **geographical coordinates** of traffic lights.
- Monitoring **vehicle speed** to assess road congestion.
- Capturing **pedestrian imagery** to determine crosswalk usage.
<br>

### ‚ú® Expectations
1. **Rapid Resolution of Traffic Jams and Accident Prevention**  
   - Enhancing the quality of life for citizens and contributing to the realization of a smart city.

2. **Advancement in Digital Public Administration**  
   - Proactively identifying urban issues and inconveniences through data analytics before complaints are received.

3. **Data Integration into 'Data Hubs'**  
   - Converging public and private data to foster an open data industry.

4. **Enhanced Traffic Management through Data Analysis**  
   - Gaining insights and improving the traffic experience by utilizing secondary processed data.

5. **Traffic Signal System Metrics**  
   - Monitoring the number of manual system transitions per traffic light.
   - Recording the duration of manual system control per traffic light.
   - Logging start and end times of transitions.
<br>

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Potential Side Effects
1. **Privacy Concerns**  
   - The risk of personal information or travel path data being leaked or misused.

2. **Increased Dependence on Technology**  
   - Vulnerability to disruptions in the event of technical errors or system failures.

3. **Unintended Traffic Redistribution**  
   - Traffic signal adjustments made to alleviate congestion in one area may inadvertently increase congestion in other areas.
